## Background - This project is mainly a learning resource for writing Jasmine tests. It uses the Google Feed Reader API to grab RSS feeds as a JSON object as well as the Handlebars templating library and jQuery. See the project overview here if you are interested in the testing goals: [a relative link](ProjectOverview.md)

## Contributing

Ideas regarding how to approach this project were were found in Udacity course resources, especially using the walkthrough by Matthew Cranford (https://matthewcranford.com/feed-reader-walkthrough-part-4-async-tests/), the  Knowledge Boards, as well as Udacity course materials, CSS Tricks, and the Jasmine Documentation.  I kept the console.log(s) and the original comments in the code for learning purposes and context.
